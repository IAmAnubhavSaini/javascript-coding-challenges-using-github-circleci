# javascript-coding-challenges-using-github-circleci

Yet another coding challenges, this time with a twist and the twist is;

1. Code is written on github (each branch contains contains 1 question)
2. Tests against your code executed at [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/engintekin/javascript-coding-challenges-using-github-circleci)

## How it works?
1. Fork the repository to your account.
2. Pick a question by switching to the related branch (e.g., [rotation](https://github.com/engintekin/javascript-coding-challenges-using-github-circleci/tree/rotation))
3. Edit `solution.js` ([Editing files in your repository](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/))
4. Create a pull request to the original repo 

That's it, you are ready to go, [circleci](https://circleci.com/gh/engintekin/javascript-coding-challenges-using-github-circleci) will start running the tests against your solution and hopefully your solution will succeed. Now start hacking by forking it!
