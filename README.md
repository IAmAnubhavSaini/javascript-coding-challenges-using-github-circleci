[Reverse Polish notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation?oldformat=true) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, in contrast to Polish notation, which puts the operator in the prefix position. How will you calculate given Reverse Polish notation?

#### Example:

* `["3", "5", "+", "2", "*"] -> ((3 + 5) * 2) -> 16`
* `["7", "11", "5", "/", "+"] -> (7 + (11 / 5)) -> 9`
